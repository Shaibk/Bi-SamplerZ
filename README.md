# Bi-SamplerZ
[**Bi-SamplerZ**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24509) is a high-efficiency, fully hardware-implemented dual-path discrete Gaussian sampler designed to accelerate [**Falcon**](https://falcon-sign.info/) signature generation. By utilizing a dual-datapath architecture and an assistance mechanism, Bi-SamplerZ generates two sampling results simultaneously, improving both speed and area efficiency. Experimental results show that it reduces the sampling cycle count by 54.1%, achieving the best-known area-time product (ATP) for hardware-based sampler designs. With both ASIC and FPGA implementations, Bi-SamplerZ proves to be a high-performance solution for post-quantum cryptographic systems like Falcon.
